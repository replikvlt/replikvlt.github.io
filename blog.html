BTC Key pair with ReactOS and Python 3 - 3 Jan 2020</b></font></font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

			</p>
			<p>If you decided to try out Bitcoin then you probably have asked
			yourself “but how do i create bitcoin wallet?” While yes as you
			probably tried to answer ti yourself, there are some services online
			where you could register your wallet. Honestly speaking this is not
			quite safe and secure, everything that relates to both internet and
			bitcoin keys in combination. So I’m gonna tell you partially how I
			did it offline.</p>
			<h3 class="western">Yes indeed bitcoin wallet can be created
			completely offline from “plain air”.</h3>
			<p>Thanks for this discovery to my friend from <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/">sindastra.de</a></p>
			<h3 class="western">In fact this is the preferred, secure way.</h3>
			<p>Actually most people recommend using  Tails OS Live USB for
			creating key pairs. <strike>And after that to burn the flash drive
			used with Tesla Not a Flamethrower:)</strike></p>
			<p style="text-decoration: none">Tails OS is “The amnesic incognito
			live system” - great system for anonimity and information security.</p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: none">More at <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">tails.boum.org</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: none">I have nothing against Tails
			and you probably should use it, however here I will tell you how I
			did create my keys using ReactOS</span><span style="text-decoration: none">.
			Why and what is ReactOS?! </span><a href="https://www.reactos.org/"><span style="text-decoration: none">More...</span></a></p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: none">Why?</span></p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: none">Well in my imagination based
			on what I read online, to get the same key generated (in hope to
			hijack someones account) </span><span style="text-decoration: none">one</span><span style="text-decoration: none">
			has to have same setup, so my decision on using ReactOS came directly
			as  resolution of this. No-one ever in their sane mind would use
			ReactOS by the time of writing this post </span><span style="text-decoration: none">because
			it is alpha stage software, and not really usable in day to day use</span><span style="text-decoration: none">
			so no one would be able to pick same key.</span></p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: none">What?</span></p>
			<p><a name="cite_ref-7"></a><span style="text-decoration: none">“</span><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>ReactOS</b></span><span style="text-decoration: none">
			is a free and open-source operating syste</span><span style="text-decoration: none">m</span><span style="text-decoration: none">
			for amd64/i686 personal computers intended to be binary-compatible
			with computer programs and device drivers made for Windows Server
			2003 and later versions of Windows.” - </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReactOS"><span style="text-decoration: none">Wikipedia</span></a></p>
			<p>I used virt-manager qemu Virtual Machine to install ReactOS.
			Installation is pretty straight-forward and simmilar to that of
			WindowsXP.</p>
			<p>Because it is not complete yet, after installation it would ask to
			install few drivers but it will fail finding them online. I just
			cancelled them.</p>
			<p>After that I opened the Application Manager and searched for
			Python 3.6. Installed it.</p>
			<p>Since there is some issue where python installed doesn’t add
			python’s folder to PATH I just opened cmd.exe, changed directory to
			C:/Python36/Scripts and ran pip.exe to install needed libraries
			base58 ecdsa</p>
			<pre>pip.exe install base58 ecdsa
			</pre><p>
			and then you need to write this little python program in notepad from
			<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tzq3w/generate_your_own_private_key_5_lines_of_python/dy2bfcy/">Here…
			(reddit)</a></p>
			<p>and then change directory to C:/Python36/ and run</p>
			<pre>python.exe &lt;path to file you typed&gt;</pre><p>
			(instead of typing path by hand, you can just drop file inside the
			cmd widow to insert it)</p>
			<p>There you go it shall generate both public and private key. Now
			you can run this few times and generate key you would like. After
			that important part is to save both keys, public key can be shared
			online but private should be hidden. Saving private key digitally is
			really bad practice so idk. Write it on paper or something:)</p>
			<p>Thanks for reading my blog post!</p>

			<h3>Setting up on-the-go development environment  - 14 Oct 2019</h3>
			<h4>using power of *nix, ssh and editor such as vim or nano</h4>
			<p>At this very day and age everyone has powerfull
			computers in their pockets, namely mobile devices powered by Android or iOS. That
			said, being powerfull doesn't exactly mean that you can use them alone as a
			development platform. Some could argue with this, but the standard Android
			shell,for instance, lacks compilers and it's implementation of Java virtual machine is
			quite limited, it has no way to compile Java source program IIRC. That's exactly
			why we need a PC with Android Studio installed to compile applications for
			them.</p>
			<p>However one can use his mobile device as a sole interface to a machine (a PC or a
			workstation) using <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh">SecureShell</a>. For this you would need to install ssh on both
			the workstation and a mobile device.<br>On mobile devices there are a lot of
			tools now created for system administrators which can be used to manage PCs by utilizing ssh such
			as <a href="https://www.termius.com">Termius</a>, <a
			href="https://termux.com">Termux</a> and many others. I myself have used both, but prefer Termux
			as it also allows me to manage my phone.<br>Now next thing is to set up your favourite editors on your development machine. In my
			instance i was playing with Java so i set up vim with a nice dark color scheme,
			used <a
			href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1785">javacomplete</a>
			plug-in which allowed me to have some autocompletion like you would get on any
			moder IDE and of course i downloaded OpeJDK on my PC to be able to build and run my Java
			programs.</p>
			<p>This is how it looked</p>
			<img
			src="https://cdn.niu.moe/media_attachments/files/003/409/794/original/66e9d82453d6e1cb.jpg"
			alt="Screenshot of my Android phone running Termux and me being connected via
			ssh to the PC and editing Java file in vim editor with color scheme and
			javacomplete autocomplete plug-in">
					<p>Later i discovered there is a more
			powerfull javacomplete plug-in <a
			href="https://github.com/artur-shaik/vim-javacomplete2">vim-javacomplete2</a>
			which has a much more refined autocomplete system and code templates and other
			nitty features, however thing to consider is that your vim editor has to be
			compiled with scripting languages support (python support)</p>
			<p>There are also other powerfull tools and plug-ins:<br>
			*<a href="https://eclim.org">Eclim</a><br>
			*<a
			href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim">Omnisharp-vim</a><br>
			*<a
			href="http://ycm-core.github.io/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a><br>
			and much more</p>
			<p>Now obviously you would also need to connect to your PC and in the local network it's easy, but if you want to write things in ouside. For that you would have to expose your PC to the network. Which you could do in several ways like:<br>
			*Port Forwarding<br>
			*Using Ngrok</p>
			<p>I used last option, and while it can be not too secure, it is easier to use</p>
			<p>That's it really, Happy Hacking on the go!</p>
