			<h3>Setting up on-the-go development environment</h3>
			<h4>using power of *nix, ssh and editor such as vim or nano</h4>
			<p>At this very day and age everyone has powerfull
computers in their pockets, namely mobile devices powered by Android or iOS. That
said, being powerfull doesn't exactly mean that you can use them alone as a
development platform. Some could argue with this, but the standard Android
shell,for instance, lacks compilers and it's implementation of Java virtual machine is
quite limited, it has no way to compile Java source program IIRC. That's exactly
why we need a PC with Android Studio installed to compile applications for
them.</p>
			<p>However one can use his mobile device as a sole interface to a machine (a PC or a
workstation) using <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh">SecureShell</a>. For this you would need to install ssh on both
the workstation and a mobile device.<br>On mobile devices there are a lot of
tools now created for system administrators which can be used to manage PCs by utilizing ssh such
as <a href="https://www.termius.com">Termius</a>, <a
href="https://termux.com">Termux</a> and many others. I myself have used both, but prefer Termux
as it also allows me to manage my phone.<br>Now next thing is to set up your favourite editors on your development machine. In my
instance i was playing with Java so i set up vim with a nice dark color scheme,
used <a
href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1785">javacomplete</a>
plug-in which allowed me to have some autocompletion like you would get on any
moder IDE and of course i downloaded OpeJDK on my PC to be able to build and run my Java
programs.</p>
		<p>This is how it looked</p>

alt="Screenshot of my Android phone running Termux and me being connected via
ssh to the PC and editing Java file in vim editor with color scheme and
javacomplete autocomplete plug-in">
		<p>Later i discovered there is a more
powerfull javacomplete plug-in <a
href="https://github.com/artur-shaik/vim-javacomplete2">vim-javacomplete2</a>
which has a much more refined autocomplete system and code templates and other
nitty features, however thing to consider is that your vim editor has to be
compiled with scripting languages support (python support)</p>
		<p>There are also other powerfull tools and plug-ins:<br>
			*<a href="https://eclim.org">Eclim</a><br>
			*<a
href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim">Omnisharp-vim</a><br>
			*<a
href="http://ycm-core.github.io/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a><br>
			and much more</p>
			<p>Now obviously you would also need to connect to your PC and in the local network it's easy, but if you want to write things in ouside. For that you would have to expose your PC to the network. Which you could do in several ways like:<br>
			*Port Forwarding<br>
			*Using Ngrok</p>
			<p>I used last option, and while it can be not too secure, it is easier to use</p>
			<p>That's it really, Happy Hacking on the go!</p>
